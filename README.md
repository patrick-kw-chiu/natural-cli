## natural-cli

A simple demo of CLI toolkit to perform NLP **tokenization** and **sentiment analysis** on selected files, built on top of [Natural](https://naturalnode.github.io/), [Inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/) and [Chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk)

### Usage

1. `cd` into the directory with files you want to perform NLP tasks
2. `npx natural-cli` (demo is using `node ../.` but we should use `npx natural-cli` instead)
